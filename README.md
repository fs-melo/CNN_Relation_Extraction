# CNN_Relation_Extraction
In this project, we provide our implementations of CNN for Relation_Extraction based by [deeplearning4nlp-tutorial](https://github.com/UKPLab/deeplearning4nlp-tutorial/tree/master/2017-07_Seminar/Session%203%20-%20Relation%20CNN/code), however we use dataset created by distant supervision.

The CNN architecture was implemented was inspired by [Nguyen et al. 2015] and [Zeng et al., 2014].
We use a widely used dataset developed by Riedel 2010, available in [[Lin et al., 2016](https://github.com/thunlp/NRE)]. This dataset was generated by aligning Freebase relationships with the NYT corpus.

The 01-preprocess_freebase.py file format [Lin et al., 2016](https://github.com/thunlp/NRE) dataset.

# Environment settings
We used Python 3.5, Keras and TensorFlow, in Anaconda plataform with Ubuntu 16.04.

We recommend the Virtualenv installation.

Before installing Keras, please install one of its backend engines: TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. We recommend the TensorFlow backend.

01. Install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
02. Install [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)
