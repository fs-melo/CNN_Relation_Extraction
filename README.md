# CNN_Relation_Extraction
In this project, we provide our implementations of CNN for Relation_Extraction basede in [deeplearning4nlp-tutorial](https://github.com/UKPLab/deeplearning4nlp-tutorial/tree/master/2017-07_Seminar/Session%203%20-%20Relation%20CNN/code)

The CNN architecture implemented is inspired be [Nguyen et al. 2015].
We use a widely used dataset developed by Riedel 2010, available in [[Lin et al., 2016](https://github.com/thunlp/NRE)]. This dataset was generated by aligning Freebase relationships with the NYT corpus.
