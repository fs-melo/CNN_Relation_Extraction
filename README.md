# CNN_Relation_Extraction
In this project, we provide our implementations of CNN for Relation_Extraction basede in [deeplearning4nlp-tutorial]

The CNN architecture implemented is inspired be Nguyen et al. 2015.
We use a widely used dataset developed by Riedel 2010, also used by the most recent relation extraction works [zeng2015distant][ Lin et al., 2016].
This dataset was generated by aligning Freebase relationships with the NYT corpus with sentences from 2005-2006. 70% of the samples (399,061) for training and 30 \% of the samples (171,027) were randomly selected for testing.
